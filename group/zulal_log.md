On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~30.04.2020 ~
This week I learnt basics of android studio. I have written my creatures page's code and FAQ's code. Generally I was thinking I am done with the code, I will be dealing with layout which is more demanding process. However I had some unexpected problems with my code. In this process I learnt how to connect two actvities in android studio and creating adapters in my classes. However, in the layout part my listview for FAQ did not worked so I learnt how to use recyclerview which is more developed and complex form of listview. To get information from the internet I learnt JSON, Jsoup and creating API in the android studio. Moreover, even I do not use database, I learnt it to help my other friends. Lastly, I have used Adobe XD to crete my own images in android studio. It was alsa new for me.

This week I have learned how to use Firebase and how to connect it to my android studio. I have used this cloud for creating user, for the actions sign out and sign in. Moreover, for the interface I started to work on Adobe XD to design our logos and icons.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
This week I have started to create my creatures page. For this I have learnt how to use Sqlite database. However there were some technical problems with my android studio. It took my time. Moreover, in my creatures page I show the profile pictures of the creatures. My plan was to add an searchbox to search the creatures with their names. However I could not manage to add GridViewLayout and Editable Text at the same time because they overlap each other.
