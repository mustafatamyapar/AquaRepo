On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I learnt basics of android studio. I have written my creatures page's code and FAQ's code. Generally I was thinking I am done with the code, I will be dealing with layout which is more demanding process. However I had some unexpected problems with my code. In this process I learnt how to connect two actvities in android studio and creating adapters in my classes. However, in the layout part my listview for FAQ did not worked so I learnt how to use recyclerview which is more developed and complex form of listview. To get information from the internet I learnt JSON, Jsoup and creating API in the android studio. Moreover, even I do not use database, I learnt it to help my other friends. Lastly, I have used Adobe XD to crete my own images in android studio. It was alsa new for me.

This week I have learned how to use Firebase and how to connect it to my android studio. I have used this cloud for creating user, for the actions sign out and sign in. Moreover, for the interface I started to work on Adobe XD to design our logos and icons.

This week I have started to create my creatures page. For this I have learnt how to use Sqlite database. However there were some technical problems with my android studio. It took my time. Moreover, in my creatures page I show the profile pictures of the creatures. My plan was to add an searchbox to search the creatures with their names. However I could not manage to add GridViewLayout and Editable Text at the same time because they overlap each other.

I am totally done with my part. I have used SQLiteDatabase to show and get secific information about the creature.Firstly in my creature page, I show all pictures of the creatures. The tricky part of using database is getting pictures from gallery and database. Sometmes I could not find the mistake due to the type difference.For instance, I get something integer, but I cannot use it since I have to use string of it. At that point my group member Zeynep helped me to get pictures and other information.When user clicks on the picture, it gives us the creaturesample page where detailed information about the creature listed. When user clicks on the picture, the user can chage the picture or remove the photo. Also there are three buttons for removing the creature, changing name and going to encyclopedia page. When user cliks on the tank name, the tank page appears.
