On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 25.04.2020 ~
Because we divided the work strictly this week, I started to learn android studio by using udemy.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
I completed the java, layouts and basics section in udemy. I hope what I learned will be useful when I start actual coding section in our project.
I am happy I don't have to deal with DrJava anymore(thank god)

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
I completed the android studio part, because my duty is to create a login page which requires firebase knowledge to successfully use sign-up and sign-in, I started to learn firebase and implement it on these actions.


### ~ 07.05.2020 ~
I understood what firebase is, how it works and how to use it. I started to complete my layout on login and signup pages.


### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
I implemented my firebase knowledge on login actions, I created both pages and succesfully log on with my mail. Now because my part is completed, I can implement different ideas to easen the usability of our program.

These bugs be making me acted up for real. When I click login with entering nothing in the EditText parts, the application crashes. There is no information in the internet. Trying to solve that right now.

### ~ 14.05.2020 ~
Tried to use e-mail verification to prevent users from faking their e-mail addresses, gloriously failed. There is no hope.

### ~ 15.04.2020 ~
Uhm... After trying to debug all those crazy bugs raiding every inch of the app, I managed to solve all the problems with my big brain(I just deactivated login and sign-up buttons when there is no user entry there).
Also, I added slider which is a very cool feature making going back in pages easier and cooler.

### ~ 17.05.2020 ~
Bugs, bugs and bugs... I am a survivor though, I added new animation to pages which was fun to do and cool to look at.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
I created a customizable toast message feature, which makes toss messages differentiated by their information.
Also, when you click back on main page, the program is not kicking you off of the application anymore, this means I added "double click to exit" feature.

### ~ 19.05.2020 ~
Final day, yaaay(tired dead voice)! I added a splash screen to salute user with a cool picture and a relaxing ocean sound.
