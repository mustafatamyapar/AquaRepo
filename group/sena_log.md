On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### Week April 20-26,2020
Together with the group members, I bought an Android Studio course on Udemy. I started watching and learning, as well as sketching some ideas about how I can implement my parts into code.

### Week April 27-May 3,2020
I created a Settings project on Android Studio and completed the basic navigation & design parts. On April 29, I transfered my Settings file into the project we all collaborate on (AquaRepo) so that all files are in one project. There is a problem about navigating to my settings page, I will discuss this with my fellow members tomorrow. I am still watching the videos from the Udemy course and planning to finish that course this week.
The problem with the navigation to settings page was solved.

### Week May 4-10,2020
I could not finish the course the previous week as I planned to, so I am currently watching videos.
