On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### April 23, 2020
Together with the group members, I bought an Android Studio course on Udemy. I started watching and learning, as well as sketching some ideas about how I can implement my parts into code.

### April 26, 2020
I created a Settings project on Android Studio and completed the basic navigation & design parts.

### April 29, 2020
Today, I transfered my Settings file into the project we all collaborate on (AquaRepo) so that all files are in one project. I am still watching the videos from the Udemy course, I am planning to finish that course this week.
