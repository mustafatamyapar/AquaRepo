On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### Week April 20-26,2020
Together with the group members, I bought an Android Studio course on Udemy. I started watching and learning, as well as sketching some ideas about how I can implement my parts into code.

### Week April 27-May 3,2020
I created a Settings project on Android Studio and completed the basic navigation & design parts. On April 29, I transfered my Settings file into the project we all collaborate on (AquaRepo) so that all files are in one project. There is a problem about navigating to my settings page, I will discuss this with my fellow members tomorrow. I am still watching the videos from the Udemy course and planning to finish that course this week.
The problem with the navigation to settings page was solved.

### Week May 4-10,2020
I could not finish the course the previous week as I planned to, so I am currently watching videos. UPDATE: I completed the To-Do List section. It was modified majorly, but with Zeynep (she worked on the tanks) we came up with an alternative solution to at least demonstrate some functionality.

### Week May 11-17,2020
At the beginning of this week, I added the code that enables the user to change password and e-mail(log-in credentials). This initial implementation was not completely functional though, because Firebase requires recent sign-in for updating sensitive information of a user. I solved that problem at the end of this week by adding reauthentication requirement for changing e-mail and password - the user will basically have to log in again to update e-mail or password, but it is easier and more user-friendly this way. This week I also completed the sections for changing username and profile picture. They don't require reauthentication and changing the username and profile picture was relatively easy to implement, but for displaying the profile picture I had to create a new alternative solution since some common solutions did not work in our project. I made use of Firebase Storage and GitHub's Glide. I think I completed settings section.
