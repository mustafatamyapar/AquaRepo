On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 25.04.2020 ~
We have divided the work load in a way that requires me to write my part in the later stages. I am responsible with main page and profile page. I am working on SQL and android studio

### ~ 03.05.2020 ~
I am currently working on other subjects

### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
I have talked with mustafa about the database. We should incorporate some kind of hash code in order to raise security of the passwords. I am going to talk about this more in-depth in our next meeting. Maybe
we could also incorporate some animations...

### ~ 07.05.2020 ~
I have created a basic outline and layout for the profile page. I am comfortable with using buttons and creating layouts now.
I was appearently writing my log and code on a non updated version of our repository so from now on i can check in regularly
