# CS102 ~ Group Meetings Log page ~

Below is a record of our project group meetings. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

****
### Meeting ~ April 11,2020
****
**Present:** Everyone

**Discussion:** 
We decided that we need to start working on the code of our project. We divided the work similar to the way we did while preparing the user interface report and we decided that we are going to think about how we can write our codes. 

**ToDo:** Everyone will think about how their assigned parts can be implemented to code.

****
### Meeting ~ April 20,2020 (about 5 minutes)
****
**Present:** Everyone

**Discussion**
We decided that we can work in pairs - the members who have closely related parts can write their code together so that it would be easier to connect things.

**ToDo:** Start the Android Studio course as soon as possible to be able to write the code directly on this new IDE.

****
### Meeting ~ April 21,2020 (about 10 minutes)
****
**Present:** Everyone
We met up with our TA during the lab session and discussed our plans together. She suggested that we start as soon as possible, and we set a goal to write at least some classes until our next meeting with her.

**ToDo:** Get the course if you have not yet, start watching it and try writing the code.

****
### Meeting ~ April 24,2020 (about 15 minutes)
****
**Present:** Everyone
This meeting was to tell each other about our progress. We showed each other what we have done, and also made sure that our shared repository is working well (our member ZÃ¼lal created it that day). It took multiple tries, but eventually we managed to do it. We all were continuing to watch the course and learn. We decided to keep our pace steady, contribute little by little but continuously.

**ToDo:** Keep watching the Udemy course videos and update code accordingly.
